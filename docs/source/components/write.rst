.. _write:

Write
=====

The ``write`` command is used to generate file formats such as reStructuredText from the markers extracted by the ``analyse`` command.
This allows you to create documentation that includes links to source code based on the need ids specified in your code comments.

Example usage
-------------

With the following extracted markers fron the ``analyse`` command,

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "my_project": [
           {
               "filepath": "/home/demo/git_repo/ub/sphinx-codelinks/tests/data/need_id_refs/dummy_1.cpp",
               "remote_url": "https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-codelinks/blob/951e40e7845f06d5cfc4ca20ebb984308fdaf985/tests/data/need_id_refs/dummy_1.cpp#L3",
               "source_map": {
                   "start": {"row": 2, "column": 13},
                   "end": {"row": 2, "column": 51}
               },
               "tagged_scope": "void dummy_func1(){\n     //...\n }",
               "need_ids": ["NEED_001", "NEED_002", "NEED_003", "NEED_004"],
               "marker": "@need-ids:",
               "type": "need-id-refs"
           },
       ],
   }

The following RST file with :external+needs:ref:`needextend <needextend>` directive can be generated by the ``write rst`` command:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needextend:: NEED_001
          :remote-url: https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-codelinks/blob/951e40e7845f06d5cfc4ca20ebb984308fdaf985/tests/data/need_id_refs/dummy_1.cpp#L3

   .. needextend:: NEED_002
          :remote-url: https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-codelinks/blob/951e40e7845f06d5cfc4ca20ebb984308fdaf985/tests/data/need_id_refs/dummy_1.cpp#L3

   .. needextend:: NEED_003
          :remote-url: https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-codelinks/blob/951e40e7845f06d5cfc4ca20ebb984308fdaf985/tests/data/need_id_refs/dummy_1.cpp#L3

   .. needextend:: NEED_004
          :remote-url: https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-codelinks/blob/951e40e7845f06d5cfc4ca20ebb984308fdaf985/tests/data/need_id_refs/dummy_1.cpp#L3
