New and Improved
................

- ✨ Added a new ``analyse`` CLI command and corresponding API.

  The ``analyse`` command parses source files (Python, C/C++) and extracts markers from comments.
  It can extract three types of markers, as documented in the :ref:`analyse <analyse>` section:

  - One-line need definitions
  - Need ID references
  - Marked RST blocks

  The extracted markers and their metadata are saved to a JSON file for further processing.

- ✨ Added a new ``write rst`` CLI command.

  The ``write rst`` command writes a reStructuredText file with :external+needs:ref:`needextend <needextend>` directive from the extracted markers generated by ``analyse``.
  The generated RST can be included in the Sphinx documentation to create the source code links in the existing needs

- 🔨 Replaced ``virtual_docs`` with the new ``analyse`` module.

  The ``virtual_docs`` feature, which handled one-line need definitions (:ref:`OneLineCommentStyle <oneline>`),
  has been migrated into the new ``analyse`` module and removed from the core.
  The caching feature of ``virtual_docs`` is temporarily removed and may be reintroduced later.

- 🔨 Updated the ``src-trace`` Sphinx directive.

  The ``src-trace`` directive now uses the new ``analyse`` API instead of the old ``virtual_docs`` one.

- 🔨 Unified configuration in TOML

  The configuration for ``src-trace`` directive defined in TOML is now compatible with the new ``analyse`` module.

Fixes

- 🐛 Apply default configuration values when not given

  When a user does not specify certain configuration options, the extension will automatically use predefined default
  values, allowing users to get started quickly without needing to customize every option.
  Users can override these defaults by explicitly providing their own configuration values.

- 🐛 Fix local links for multi project configurations

  Local links between docs and one-line need definitions work correctly, when :ref:`src_dir <source_dir>` in multiple
  project configurations point at different locations.
