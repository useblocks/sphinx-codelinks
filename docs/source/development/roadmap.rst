Roadmap
=======

Other Comment styles
--------------------

Currently, only ``C/C++`` comment style is supported.
The other comment styles for different programming languages are planed, such as:

- Python
- Rust

Nested .gitignore
-----------------

``CodeLinks`` respects ``.gitignore`` file, but if the .gitignore files are nested, it's not supported.
Respecting nested ``.gitignore`` in the context of the git repositories is planned.
