Roadmap
=======

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

- Introduce configurable ``--verbose`` and ``--quiet`` logging options.

Configuration Files
-------------------

- Support automatic discovery of TOML configuration files (e.g., ``pyproject.toml``).
- Improve integration with the ``ubCode`` and ``Sphinx-Needs`` ecosystems.

Source Code Parsing
-------------------

- Enrich tagged scopes with additional metadata.
- Extend language support by adding parsers for more comment styles, including but not limited to:

  - Rust

- Enhance ``.gitignore`` handling to support nested ``.gitignore`` files.

Defining Needs in Source Code
-----------------------------

- Introduce flexible ways to define ``Sphinx-Needs`` items in source code, such as custom multi-line need comments.
- Implement a feature to export needs defined in source code to a ``needs.json`` file, improving CI workflows and portability.
