         ``Sphinx-CodeLinks`` is a lightweight solution for enabling traceability between source code and documentation.
         With a single line in your code, you can:

         1. Defining new ``Sphinx-Needs`` - extracted and integrated into the Sphinx build
         2. Embedding existing need IDs - extracted for cross-referencing with need items in the documentation
